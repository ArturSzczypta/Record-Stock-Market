# Record Stock Market

Record Stock Market is a project aimed at scraping data from the Polish Stock Market as well as relevant international indexes and commodities. The collected data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database and accessed and modified using Python.

The ultimate goal of this project is to utilize the collected data to train trading bots and evaluate their performance in achieving breakeven points.
